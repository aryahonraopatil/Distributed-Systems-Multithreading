# Distributed_Systems_Multithreading
A Multithreading program to calculate the sum of integers

The program takes two command-line input parameters: M and fname where M is an integer and fname is the pathname (absolute) to the input data file.

The format of the input data file is: a sequence of integers separated by white space, written in ASCII decimal text notation; you may assume that each integer is the ASCII representation of a 64-bit signed integer. The program spawns M workers threads and one coordinator thread. The main() of your program simply spawns the coordinator. The workers and the coordinator are implemented as goroutines in the GoLang. Workers can communicate with the coordinator but do not communicate among themselves. GoLang channels have been used for interaction between the workers and the coordinators.

The coordinator partitions the data file in M equal-size contiguous fragments; each kth fragment will be given to the kth worker via a JSON message of the form that includes the datafile's filename and the start and end byte position of the kth fragment, eg "{datafile: fname, start: pos1 , end: pos2}" for a fragment with the bytes in the interval [pos1, pos2). 
Each worker upon receiving its assignment via a JSON message it computes a partial sum and count which is the sum and count of all the integers which are fully contained within its assigned fragment. It also identifies a prefix or suffix of its fragment that could be part of the two integers that may have been split between its two adjacent (neighboring) fragments. Upon completion, the worker communicates its response to the coordinator via a JSON message with the partial sum and count, suffix, and prefix of its fragment, as well as it's fragments start and end eg: a worker whose assigned fragment that starts at 40, ends by 55, and contains "1224 5 8 10 678" will respond with the message "{psum: 23, pcount: 3, prefix: '1224 ', suffix: ' 678', start:40, end:55}". The coordinator, upon receving a response from each worker, accumulates all the workers's partial sums and counts, as well as the sums and counts of the couple of integers in the concatenation of kth suffix and (k+1)th prefix (received by the the workers assigned the kth and (k+1)th fragments respectively. Upon receiving responses from all the workers, the coordinator prints and returns the average of the numbers in the datafile.
